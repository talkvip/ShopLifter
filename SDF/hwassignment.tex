% ValuJet Essay Assignment — Write a 5000-word essay on the ValuJet article from
% the Atlantic Magazine, which I will provide for you. This is also a
% "critical thinking" exercise, and is partly an opinion piece, so again there
% is no wrong answer. The essay should be in three parts:
% 1) a synopsis of the article's main points as far as the crash, the
% investigation, and its cause;
% 2) your thoughts on the ethics issues involved, detailing not just what was
% wrong, but why it was wrong and its possible contributions to other potential
% catastrophic system failures; and
% 3) the types of similar or different problems which might arise when planning,
% designing, and developing a software product or application.

There are always mistakes and problems that may arise in the course of
engineering, but few things are as tragic as when lives are lost as a result of
avoidable mistakes.  ``The Lessons of ValuJet 592'' by William Langewiesche
follows the crash, the investigation, and provides insight that might be gained
from ValuJet 592, a twin-engine DC-9 that crashed in May of 1996.  By reviewing
the nature and origin of past problems which led to this accident we can learn
lessons to apply to our future software development.

The article begins with a description of the crash by Walton Little, an
observer who happened to be fishing near the site of the crash.  Mr. Little
reported that, ``There was no smoke, no strange engine noise, no debris in the
air, no dangling materials or control surfaces, no apparent deformation of the
airframe, and no areas that appeared to have missing panels or surfaces,'' before
the plane flew straight into the ground.  Little's account of what was not
present is significant because it rules out many of the typical explanations
involved in plane crashes.  Without any evidence of an engineered problem it
was at first difficult to comprehend why ValuJet 592 had flown straight into
the ground.

Langewiesche remarks that even with a reason for the crash having been found and
actions taken by ValuJet and the FAA, it does not mean that the problem is truly
resolved.  The reason why a true resolution is difficult to find in the ValuJet
592 crash is because of the nature of the accident.  Langwiesche breaks airplane
accidents into three types, as outlined in the table below.  The first two of
which are natural to think of, but the third of which is the elusive trouble-maker
that is difficult to address and that some argue we cannot avoid in the future.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|p{9cm}|}\hline
        \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Types of airplane accidents}\\\hline
        ``Procedural'' & Result from single obvious mistakes \\\hline
        ``Engineered'' & Materials failures that should have been predicted
        by designers or discovered by test pilots. Usually defy understanding
        at first but yield to examination and result in tangible solutions. \\\hline
        ``System'' & Most elusive.  Charles Perrow, a Yale sociologist, calls
        these ``normal'' accidents because they are the ``bastards born of the
        confusion that lies within the complex organizations with which we
        manage our dangerous technologies.'' \\\hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Langewiesche notes that ``safety is never first, and it never will be,'' because
of the competitive nature of flying.  It is expensive to fly, but there are
increasing amounts of people who are willing to pay a reduced fare to fly.  This
offers a growing market to airlines who are able to find ways to save money, even
if this means cutting corners.  And that is exactly what ValuJet was doing; when
ValuJet 592 took its fateful flight ValuJet was a rapidly expanding company that
had found many ways to reduce costs by cutting corners.

Dan Pink at a talk for the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts,
Manufactures and Commerce, the RSA, mentioned that one way to motivate people
in jobs that are knowledge-based is to, ``pay people enough so
they’re not thinking about money but thinking about their work,'' and that the
three factors that lead to better performance after money is taken ``off the
table'' are autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

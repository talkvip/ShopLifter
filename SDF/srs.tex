\abstract{
eCommerce CMS is a software solution for small business customers looking for
an initial online presence.  The eCommerce CMS application will offer both a
web service for HTTP requests and sets of internet-accessible web pages served
by that web service.

This Software Requirements Specification is intended to outline the necessary
outcomes and performance specifications required for eCommerce CMS to be
considered fully functional and deployable.

\section{Software Requirements Specification}

\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Identification}

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents the requirements for
the small business utility web service and web site, called eCommerce CMS.

\subsubsection{System Overview}

The eCommerce CMS application will offer a Java-based web service which will
allow for HTTP requests to qualified users.  The Java-based service will also
serve two sets of front-end web pages.  Through the first set, small business
users of the application can implement and manage an online business management
and sales solution. Through the second set, customers of the small business will
be able to interact with the small business either through making purchases on
an eCommerce web site or through committing information required for generation
of a proposal.

\subsubsection{Document Overview}

This SRS is a minimized form of a typical SRS due to time constraints.  In the
following sections there will be a section dedicated to Functional Requirements,
Performance Requirements, and finally Environmental Requirements.  Following these
Requirements sections there will be an appendix.

Table~\ref{terms} defines key terms that are used within this document.

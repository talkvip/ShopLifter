\abstract{
eCommerce CMS is a software solution for small business customers looking for
an initial online presence.  The eCommerce CMS application will offer both a
web service for HTTP requests and sets of internet-accessible web pages served
by that web service.

This Software Requirements Specification is intended to outline the necessary
outcomes and performance specifications required for eCommerce CMS to be
considered fully functional and deployable.

\section{Software Requirements Specification}

\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Identification}

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents the requirements for
the small business utility web service and web site, called eCommerce CMS.

\subsubsection{System Overview}

The eCommerce CMS application will offer a Java-based web service which will
allow for HTTP requests to qualified users.  The Java-based service will also
serve two sets of front-end web pages.  Through the first set, small business
users of the application can implement and manage an online business management
and sales solution. Through the second set, customers of the small business will
be able to interact with the small business either through making purchases on
an eCommerce web site or through committing information required for generation
of a proposal.

The eCommerce CMS application is the Computer Software Configuration Item
(CSCI) and consists of three major Computer Software Components (CSC).  The
CSCI is broken down into the back-end CSC, the user front-end CSC, and the
customer front-end CSC.  Each respective CSC can further be broken down to
several Computer Software Units (CSU).  This document will specify some of the
CSU's that are intended in table~\ref{software-hierarchy}, but this list shall
in no way bind or limit the number of CSU's that will be developed within
eCommerce CMS.

\subsubsection{Document Overview}

This SRS is a minimized form of a typical SRS due to time constraints.  The
remainder of this document is structured as follows.  Section 5.2 contains
Functional Requirements, Section 5.3 contains Performance Requirements, and
finally Section 5.4 contains Environmental Requirements.  Following these
Requirements sections there will be an appendix.

Table~\ref{terms} defines key terms that are used within this document.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

The application will serve eCommerce web pages allowing inventory data to be
manipulated and transacted with by the user and customer's, respectively.  The
user will have the ability to also manipulate the display of the customer's
front-end.

The Functional Requirements section is segmented into subsections consisting of
one functional requirement each.  These subsections flow sequentially from
back-end, to user front-end, and finally to customer front-end.

\subsubsection{Functional Back-End Requirement 1}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

\subsubsection{Performance Requirement 1}
\label{perf-back-end-1}

The back-end shall respond to all front-end page requests through HTTP endpoints
within 2 seconds in accordance with functional back-end
requirement~\ref{func-back-end-1}.

\subsection{Environment Requirements}

\subsubsection{Development Environment Requirements}

The application is developed with Java 1.6+ with packages provided by
Maven.  There are no specific system requirements for the development of
the application besides the ability to use Java and the packages provided
by Maven.

\subsubsection{Execution Environment Requirements}

The back-end is served from a web server or from a hosting solution provider and is
required to have the minimum specifications outlined in table~\ref{server}.  The
server itself requires minimum hardware support, but does require an always-on
network connection through which to serve the service and web pages.  A Java
Development Kit (JDK) of version 1.5 or newer is required to compile and package
the Maven repository that will be used.

The front-end is served as web pages within supported web browsers, as listed in
table~\ref{browsers}.  This does not constitue a complete list of supported web
browsers, but is a brief list of web browsers that are guaranteed to be supported
by the web sites.
